Implemented in Ruby on Rails 5.0.1.
Background job is handled by Sidekiq.
Message/work qeueuing is handled by Redis. 

Requirements:
     [Ruby Version Manager (RVM)](https://rvm.io/)
    - [Ruby 2.3.1](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/)
    - [Rails 5.0.1](http://rubyonrails.org/)
    - [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
    - [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/) 
    - [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
    - [Redis](https://redis.io/)

## Getting started (development mode)
#### *currently runs only in a development mode, production mode guide will be added in the future*


*To configure your whole system for the application, please follow this [link](Installation_guide.md)*

### Option #1 (Manual)
To get started with the app, move to the work directory where you want to have the app and clone the repo: 
```
git clone https://github.com/icclab/disco-dashboard.git
```

Move to app's folder and run bundle install:
```
$ cd disco-dashboard
$ bundle install --without production
```

Execute [figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) gem:
```
bundle exec figaro install
```

Set up environment variables in *config/application.yml*:
```
development:
  # DISCO endpoint (e.g. 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/haas/')
  disco_ip: 'http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:port/haas/' 
  # App needs a fingerprint that is generated by DISCO framework to not load those keypairs.
  # The one below was used when this readme was written, in case it is outdated, you need to update it.
  fingerprint: "b2:c1:f1:50:e3:f8:7b:88:fa:e3:b1:97:a5:6b:32:27"
```

Next, do the database migration:
```
$ rails db:migrate
```

To fill the database with a fake data run:
```
$ rails db:seed
```

On a different terminal or screen, but from the same directory run sidekiq:
```
$ bundle exec sidekiq
```
It will handle all background jobs.

Also, make sure that redis-server is also running. To run redis-server use following command on a separate terminal or screen:
```
$ redis-server
```
It's needed for ActionCable and Sidekiq support. In the app redis server is configured to the default port 6379.

Finally, to run the app in a local server(will run on localhost):
```
$ rails server
```
Or from remote server you also need to bind it to the IP address (e.g. VM on cloud):
```
$ rails server -b "server_ip" -p "port"
```
"server_ip" is a local ip, not a floating ip if server is running on Cloud VM, however should be accessed using a floating ip. And make sure that specified port is open. 
*Rails will run on port '3000' by default, if port is not specified.*


### Option #2 (Semi-automated)

#### Will be added soon
